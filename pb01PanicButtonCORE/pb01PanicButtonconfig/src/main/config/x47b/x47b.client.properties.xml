	<!-- REST end points from the client view -->
	<!--
	This config ONLY is used if the client cannot access the CORE services directly 
	(the CORE bean services jar -x47bServicesClasses.jar- is NOT available in the client's classpath)
	
	For example, if the client is an UI (that's the case of x47bPanicButtonWar):
		- If the UI War is deployed in a Weblogic's EAR alonside other app components, it usually has the core services available at the classpath
		  (the core services jar -x47bServicesClasses.jar- is usually at APP-INF/lib) so the UI War WILL NOT use the REST services (x47bServicesWar)
		  ... so the below restEndPoints config will not be used since REST services will not be used
		  
		- If the UI War is deployed independently, usually, it'll NOT have the core services available in the classpath
		  (x47bPanicButtonWar do not have a dependency on x47bServicesClasses.jar) so it'll try to use REST services 
		  and to reach them the below restEndPoints config is used
